# Analyzing Agricultural Productivity Across Indian States 🌾📊

## 📌 Project Overview
Agricultural production in India varies widely across states due to differences in climate, resource availability, and agricultural input usage such as fertilizers and pesticides. These variations impact **food security**, **farmer income**, and **resource efficiency**.

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing agricultural productivity across Indian states using **Power BI**, converting raw datasets into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the major crops grown across different Indian states.
- Analyze state-wise agricultural production data over time.
- Identify trends and patterns in crop production (seasonal and yearly).
- Analyze the relationship between fertilizer usage and crop yields across different states.
- Evaluate the impact of pesticide application on agricultural productivity and crop health.
- Assess how agricultural inputs (fertilizer, pesticide, rainfall, irrigation) interact to influence crop performance.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Agricultural production in India shows significant variation across states due to:
- Climate differences  
- Fertilizer and pesticide usage levels  
- Rainfall variations  
- Irrigation availability  

Raw datasets alone do not provide actionable insights unless properly analyzed and interpreted.  
Hence, this project aims to provide interactive dashboards using **Power BI** to highlight patterns, correlations, and trends in crop productivity, supporting better decision-making.
